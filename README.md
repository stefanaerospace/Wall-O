# Wall-O
Purchased an Elegoo Smart Car V3, the obstacle avoidance code written for it was very...simple shall we say, 
  so I am in the process of improving it. 
  
It scans the environment looking for the farthest direction to go in. The objective was to make a scheme that 
  would get the agent to explore as much as possible without the ability to store current or previous locations (hardware
  is very limited).
